# MovieDB (study project)

Hosted project: https://movie-db-clouds83.vercel.app/

I created this project following a Udemy course that I took, focused in working with external API's.
The layout was a little simpler, so I improved a little.

### Built with:
- Angular 12
- PrimeNG UI components
- PrimeFlex CSS
- The Movie Database API
